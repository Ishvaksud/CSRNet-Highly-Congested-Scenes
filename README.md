Implementation CSRNet for Congested Scenes

This project aims to implements the CSRNet paper for congested scenes.

This repository contains the implementation of CSRNet, a Convolutional Sparse Representation Network, optimized for counting people in congested scenes. CSRNet is an effective crowd counting algorithm that leverages the power of convolutional neural networks to estimate crowd density maps and subsequently perform crowd counting. The model is particularly useful for scenarios where large crowds densely populate the area, such as public events, protests, or busy urban areas.It uses the concept of 'Dilation Convolution'.

The choice of framework that has been used is Pytorch.
